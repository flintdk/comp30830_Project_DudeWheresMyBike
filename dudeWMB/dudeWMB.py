#  providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish
# common tasks.
#
# Road to Enlightenment:
# Some of the things you need to know for Flask-SQLAlchemy compared to plain SQLAlchemy are:
# SQLAlchemy gives you access to the following things:
#   -> all the functions and classes from sqlalchemy and sqlalchemy.orm
#   -> a preconfigured scoped session called session
#   -> the metadata
#   -> the engine
#   -> a SQLAlchemy.create_all() and SQLAlchemy.drop_all() methods to create and drop tables according to the models.
#   -> a Model baseclass that is a configured declarative base.
# The Model declarative base class behaves like a regular Python class but has a
# query attribute attached that can be used to query the model. (Model and BaseQuery)
# We have to commit the session, but we donâ€™t have to remove it at the end of the
# request, Flask-SQLAlchemy does that for us.

    # If you want to access the 'session' using SQL Alchemy - you can do so as

    # documentation on using models appears to be lighter.
    #
    # Station.query gives you a "BaseQuery"
    # To get actual data from a "BaseQuery" you just use .all(), .first(), etc.
    # db.session.query(Station) gives you a "BaseQuery" too (same??)
